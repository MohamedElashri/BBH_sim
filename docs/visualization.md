# Visualization

The BBH_SIM package provides functions to visualize the simulation results, including plotting the orbits of the black holes and the gravitational waveforms.

## Plotting Orbits

To visualize the orbits of the black holes in a 3D plot, use the `plot_orbits_3d()` function:

```python
from BBH_SIM.visualization import plot_orbits_3d

plot_orbits_3d(simulation.r1_array, simulation.r2_array)
```

This function takes the position arrays of the two black holes (`r1_array` and `r2_array`) as input and generates a 3D plot showing their trajectories.

You can customize the plot by passing additional keyword arguments to the function, such as `fig`, `ax`, `show`, `save_path`, and other matplotlib plotting options.

## Plotting Waveforms

To plot the gravitational waveforms generated by the binary black hole system, use the `plot_waveform()` function:

```python
from BBH_SIM.visualization import plot_waveform

plot_waveform(simulation.t_array, h_plus, h_cross)
```

This function takes the time array (`t_array`) and the plus and cross polarizations of the gravitational waveform (`h_plus` and `h_cross`) as input and generates a plot showing the waveforms.

You can customize the plot by passing additional keyword arguments to the function, similar to `plot_orbits_3d()`.

## Plotting from File

If you have saved the simulation data to a file using `simulation.save_data()`, you can directly plot the orbits or waveforms from the file using the `plot_from_file()` function:

```python
from BBH_SIM.visualization import plot_from_file

plot_from_file("simulation_data.txt", plot_type="orbits")
plot_from_file("simulation_data.txt", plot_type="waveform")
```

This function takes the file path of the simulation data file and the `plot_type` parameter to specify whether to plot the orbits or the waveforms.

For more information on generating the gravitational waveforms, please refer to the [Waveform](waveform.md) section of the documentation.
